# In this example, we do not attempt to create mutually exclusive (or
# overlapping) groups of SRPs. This mirrors Blackburn et al's original paper
# where SRPs were counted as one group. There are different ways of grouping
# these presentations. See, for example, the SRP list by NÃ­ Chobhthaigh et al,
# also available through the ECHILD Phenotype Code List Repository, which 
# contains alternative and more up-to-date groupings.


# set-up ------------------------------------------------------------------

# Clear workspace

# Set global settings, such as your working directory, load libraries and specify
# the ODBC connection string.

# convert to long format --------------------------------------------------

# It is significantly easier to work with the diagnostic data in long format.
# This is especially so when working across NPD and HES, or when adopting a 
# spine-based approach as we do in the "How To?" guides. But even here,
# working with just one year of HES data, it is quicker and easier to identify
# relevant episodes in long format and then specify flags in the wide format data.

# We also need only emergency admissions, and so we use the emergency admissions
# code list to identify and retain only these in our long-format data.

# There are some codes in HES with 5 or 6 characters, some of which which relate
# to the asterisk and dagger system (see the primer for details). As these are not
# relevant, we truncate all codes to the first 4 characters only.

# Create a binary flag that indicates whether an episode contains a relevant code.

# Most codes are only counted if they are in the first diagnostic position. We
# therefore also need to create a variable that contains the diag number. We
# will use the existing diag_n variable and remove everything before and
# including the underscore.
diagnoses[, diag_n := as.integer(gsub("diag_", "", diag_n))]


# identify episodes with relevant codes -----------------------------------

# Here we look for both codes and set the new binary
# indicator to TRUE where a relevant code is found.
# (If we had not converted to long format, we would have to apply this operation
# across several columns, which is difficult to code and may take a very significant
# amount of time, especially when using a for loop or the apply() functions.)

# We start with the codes only valid in the first diagnostic position.

# Now aggregate to episode level. We do this by taking the max() of our
# binary SRP variable by token_person_id and epistart. This aggregates

# Deal with flags ---------------------------------------------------------

# We do not need to worry about the remaining two flags: selfharm_xz_code and
# pers_hist. The latter is only relevant when creating mutually exclusive groups.
# The former indicates that certain codes (T36-T50 and certain codes from the
# S block) are only valid if they are in the first diagnostic position AND
# there is an X or Z block self-harm code in any position. However, the latter
# are always counted as SRPs and so such episodes are always counted.


# Create spine and flag ---------------------------------------------------

# We will here create a data table that contains one row per patient and then
# create flags to indicate whether a patient ever had a relevant CHC code.
# In real world settings, you might be doing this using a spine of study
# participants created elsewhere and using information only over certain time
# periods. See the ECHILD How To guides for more information and examples.
